- 👋 Hi, I’m @KDavisCodeCloud
This is my repo displaying what I'm learning and my process of each skill that I am learning. I love tech, and Cloud Computing is the future. I want to be a part of it.
Data and information is huge and where to store this data or present this data is equally important. I believe the cloud plays a pivotal role in where we are going, and saves money for businesses and allows them to be more efficient going forward.
Please take a look around. This is an opportunity to showcase my skills and if I can be a contributor to your team / business. 


- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud engineering / Devops / SRE using linux, a cloud platform, and eventually security


- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and its various services (preparing for the cloud practictioner cert as well), setting up servers, Docker containerization, Linux fundamentals (Ubuntu and Redhat), Python fundamentals, Terraform, 


- 💞️ I’m not sure what I'm looking to collaborate on yet. Still learning and applying the knowledge.
